st.write('''My project “Detection of Mental State” aims to analyze EEG (Electroencephalogram) signal data 
         to determine a person’s mental condition, such as stress, relaxation, or focus.  The system uses
          the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify brainwave patterns with high accuracy. 
         EEG data is preprocessed and key features are extracted to improve the reliability of predictions.
          A Django web interface is developed to make the results interactive and user-friendly. This project 
         contributes to understanding mental health patterns and supports earlydetection using machine learning techniques.''')
st.write('''My project “Restaurant Website” is a user-friendly web application designed to explore menus, order 
         food online, and book tables easily.It provides a visually appealing interface with sections for menu, 
         about, and contact details.Users can browse various dishes, view prices, and place orders conveniently.
         The website ensures a smooth and responsive experience on all devices.This project helps restaurants manage
         customer interactions efficiently through a digital platform.''')
